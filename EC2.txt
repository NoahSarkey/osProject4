CSE 30341-02 Project4

We elected to go for the 5pt extra credit on Project 4, making the code HTML
aware. To do this, we made sure that when searching the code only looked within
the <body> tags; this allows us to disregard HTML code that might otherwise change
the results of our searches. To do this, we found the first <body> and the
corresponding </body> and searched only within this area for the different words
that were specified in Search.txt. It followed nearly the same format as the
original implementation, but changed the start and end positions of the area being
searched.
